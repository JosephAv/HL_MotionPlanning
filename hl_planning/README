This package implements Human-Like Cartesian planning

It is composed by following nodes:
- hl_planning.cpp: taking in input the desired Cartesian pose and the time to perform movement it plan a trajectory from the actual pose to the desired one

Developed for ROS Kinetic
____________________

NECESSARY PACKAGES:
- ros_control-kinetic-devel
- franka_ros-kinetic-devel
- panda_controllers-palleschi-devel  [https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/panda_controllers/tree/palleschi-devel]

It is also necessary to install a Real Time Kernel. Instruction can be found in:
- [https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux.html]
- [https://hmenn.github.io/pages/UbuntuRT_patch.html]
____________________

INSTRUCTION:
1) launch the cartesian impedance controller:
   roslaunch panda_controllers cartesian_impedance_controller_softbots.launch

2) run the planner:
   rosrun hl_planning hl_planning
____________________

REMEMBER:
1) Change robot IP in "cartesian_impedance_controller_softbots.launch" file with actual robot IP
2) Verify end-effector inertial information in Franka Desk for a correct gravity compensation
3) Control at line 18 of "hl_planning.cpp" address of .csv file to be loaded
